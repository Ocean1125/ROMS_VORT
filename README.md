# A simple tutorial for running ROMS_VORT

## About ROMS_VORT

The ROMS_VORT is a package that calculates the vorticity budget equations by using the ROMS diagnostic u/v and averging outputs. There are **three** different forms of vorticity budget equations, the 2D depth-averaged vorticity equation (vort_2d), the 2D transport vorticity equation (vort_2dtrans), and the 3D depth-dependent vorticity equation (vort_3d). The detailed derivation of these forms can be found in Liu et al. (2020).  

Since the ROMS model takes terrain-following s-coordinate as its vertical coordinate, it's more difficult to calculate the horizontal differentiation of variables at the s-coordinate points than that using z-coordinate. In this package, we compute the terms of the vorticity equation by using the diagnostic output data of the 2D/3D momentum equations, which have been built in the ROMS model. 

The package computes each term of the 3 vorticity equations by using the diagnostic data (after you set the CPP "h file" and input "in file" options).

### 1. vort_2d (2D depth-averaged vorticity equation)

The 2D depth-averaged vorticity equation can be derived by taking curl on the 2D depth-averaged momentum equations and can be written as 

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\\underbrace{\frac{\partial\overline{\zeta}}{\partial{t}}}_{I}+\underbrace{\mathbf{U}\cdot\nabla(\frac{f}{D})}_{II}+\underbrace{\mathbf{U}\cdot\nabla(\frac{\overline{\zeta}}{D})}_{III}=\underbrace{J(\chi,D^{-1})}_{IV}+\underbrace{\nabla\times(\frac{\boldsymbol{\tau}_s}{D})}_{V}\underbrace{-\nabla\times(\frac{\boldsymbol{\tau}_b}{D})}_{VI})

Terms in the equation are (I) accelaration term (**acce_curl_2d**), (II) advection of background PV (**adv_bPV**), (III) advection of relative PV (**adv_rPV**), (IV) Joint effects of baroclinicity and relief (**JEBAR**), (V) curl of surface stress (**curl_Ts**) and (VI) curl of bottom stress (**curl_Tb**). 

### 2. vort_2dtrans (2D depth-integrated transport vorticity equation)

The 2D transport vorticity equation is the transport form of the depth-averaged vorticity equation and can be written as 

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\\underbrace{\frac{\partial{\overline{\zeta}}D}{\partial{t}}}_{I}+\underbrace{\nabla\times(D\mathbf{\overline{adv}})}_{II}=\underbrace{\nabla\times(\boldsymbol{\tau}_s-\boldsymbol{\tau}_b)}_{III}+\underbrace{\frac{1}{\rho_0}J(p_b,D)}_{IV})

Terms in the equation are (I) accelaration term (**acce_curl_2dtrans**), (II) curl of the transport advection term (**hadv_2dtrans**), (III) curl of the stress terms (**curlTs_2dtrans and curlTb_2dtrans**), (IV) bottom pressure torque term (**BPT**). The expression J stands for Jaccobian operator. 

### 3. vort_3d (3D depth-dependent vorticity equation)

The 3D depth-dependent vorticity is obtained by taking curl directly on the 3D momentum equations. It can be written as 

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\\underbrace{\frac{\partial{\zeta}}{\partial{t}}}_{I}+\underbrace{\nabla\times(\mathbf{adv})}_{II}\underbrace{-f\frac{\partial{w}}{\partial{z}}}_{III}=\underbrace{\nabla\times(\mathbf{visc})}_{IV})

Terms in the equation are (I) accelaration term (**acce_curl_3d**), (II) **nonlinear** term , (III) **divergence** term, and (IV) **viscous stress** term. 

## Tutorial for built-in test cases in ROMS

### 1. Idealized canyon case (3d)

The idealized canyon case is an idealized test of the interaction between topography and a near-steady current. This case is a suitable case to test the vorticity budget. 

#### (1) You should first run the idealized canyon (3d) with the following steps:

##### (a) Download and install ROMS 

download and compile the code step by step following the tutorial [ROMS_UNSW2008](https://www.myroms.org/wiki/ROMS_UNSW2008). Please note that, instead of making upwelling directory, you may want to make "canyon" directory by 

`mkdir canyon`

`cd canyon`

You may want to change "upwelling" to "canyon" at the following lines in the **build.bash** file:

`export ROMS_APPLICATION=canyon`
`export MY_PROJECT_DIR=${HOME}/Projects/canyon`

##### (b) Run the canyon3d case 

You may want to copy roms_canyon3d.in and canyon.h to "canyon" directory by :

`cp /srv/ckpt/roms/shared/src/ROMS/External/roms_canyon3d.in . `
`cp /srv/ckpt/roms/shared/src/ROMS/Include/canyon.h .`

To make sure the diagnostic and averaged data are output by the model, you should add 3 lines in canyon.h:

`# define AVERAGES `
`# define DIAGNOSTICS_TS`
`# define DIAGNOSTICS_UV`

After running the case following the tutorial, the results will be saved as netcdf files. Two files **roms_avg.nc** and **roms_dia.nc** are needed by the ROMS_VORT package. 

You can also simply download the nc files we have obtained at google drive [roms_avg.nc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/184_44DfY5xAnnYeN-2ax08YjedkCXBmc/view?usp=sharing) and [roms_dia.nc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CCpAlb97a_yGF19HJ1nxE-ur7-NQBeXY/view?usp=sharing) OR at baidu disk [roms_avg.nc](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Qjkjy9H0aBYg6z9HlWGzzQ) (code: 365x) and [roms_dia.nc](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1L8LGVGjJqbDdUrXcoaErTg) (code: g8qy).

##### (c) Download the ROMS_VORT package 

You can get the both Matlab and Python scripts at [github](https://github.com/rayliuxh/ROMS_VORT.git) by run the script 
`git clone https://github.com/rayliuxh/ROMS_VORT.git ROMS_VORT` 
or download the repository directly at the website.

##### (d) Calculate the vorticity balances 

If you prefer **Matlab**:

There are 2 Matlab scripts in the ROMS_VORT folder. Run `get_circu_pattern_pub.m` to load the ocean state variables and make some plots. Run `get_pv_conservation_pub.m` to calculate the **three** different forms of the vorticity equations and do some plots. The detailed information of the variables in the script can be found in the above description.  

If you prefer **Python**:

You can find a py script containing the calculating functions of the vorticity budget and a notebook that giving a demo calculation of the 3 forms of vorticity equations. You could first change the path of the nc files at the beginning of roms_vort.py and then run the **user_interface_roms_vort.ipynb** to get each term of the vorticity balances. 

### 2. Upwelling case

The Upwelling case is the default test case in ROMS. If you are not familiar with the compiling and running procedures of ROMS model, you can start from this case and then apply the ROMS_VORT package. Follow the following steps:

(1) Download and install ROMS step by step with the tutorial [ROMS_UNSW2008](https://www.myroms.org/wiki/ROMS_UNSW2008). After running the upwelling case by following the tutorial, the results will be saved as netcdf files. You can also simply download the nc files we have obtained at [upwelling results](https://figshare.com/account/projects/81329/articles/12375272).

(2) you could then apply the ROMS_VORT package to the results of the upwelling case. 

### 3. Real topography case

Liu et al. (2020) has applied the package to the problem of on-shelf intrusions of the Kuroshio northeast of Taiwan. If you have are interested in that work. Please contact Xiaohui Liu (xh_liu@sio.org.cn) for more details.
